<br /><br />
Created a function to generate the password (onClick html triggers this) using if and else statements to give a result.
<br />
Result is written innerHTML to text area on index.html
<br />
The Bonus was to create a clipboard to copy
<br />
Creating a function using textarea.select
<br />
and execCommand("Copy") in Javascript
<br />
And a button labeled *Copy to Clipboard* in html
<br />
with *onClick* to that function allows user to copy their generated password
